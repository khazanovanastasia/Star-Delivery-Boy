# Narrative Tone & Style — Star Delivery Boy

Star Delivery Boy is an anti-utopian urban survival tale.

The tone emphasizes:
- loneliness
- precarity
- economic pressure
- underground activity
- coping mechanisms
- quiet rebellion

The visual style:
- pixel art
- saturated palette
- expressive, rough aesthetic ??

The player is not a hero.
They simply survive — and make small choices that shape their days.
